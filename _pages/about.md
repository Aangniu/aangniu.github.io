About
======
I joined LMU Munich in 2021 as a PhD student in Computational Seismology under the supervision of Prof. Heiner Igel and Prof. Alice-Agnes Gabriel. I am one of the Early Stage Researchers in [SPIN-ITN](https://spin-itn.eu/) project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action (MSCA). My research concerns the propagation of mechanical waves in nonlinear materials (theoretical and numerical aspects). In particular, I
1. provide sets of numerical simulation results to explore sensitivities of various nonlinear rheologies; 
1. develop 3D nonlinear wave simulation tools across the scales from laboratory (rock), to engineering structures (buildings and bridges), to field (crust); 
1. investigate effects of nonlinear rheology on earthquakes from source (dynamic rupture), path (co-seismic wave speed changes) and site (gound motions).
1. use scenario calculations to optimize the experimental design.
