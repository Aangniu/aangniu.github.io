Compare with experimental observation; Discuss what physical mechanism and mathematical forms can contribute 
* Initial strain in the rocks
* Strain-rate (frequency) dependent behavior
* Amplitude dependent damage

Bring the simulation from 2D to 3D
* Implementation of nonlinear wave solver in SeisSol for large scale 3D simulations.
