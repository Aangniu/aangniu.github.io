3D simulation of co-seismic wave speed changes in rock from source to site
* Simulation Mw 7.8 Gorkha Earthquake in 2015.
* Understand basin effects with different types of rheology: elastic, visco-elastic, plastic and nonlinear damage models.
* Account for finite earthquake source, heterogeneous velocity structure, surface topography, basin geometry, etc.
